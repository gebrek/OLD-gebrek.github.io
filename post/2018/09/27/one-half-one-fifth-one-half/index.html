<p>It has been about four weeks since the start of the period, and the
semester. The classes have been alright, although I had to drop the
one I was really interested in: Lambda Calculus. Not sure if I'll ever
have a satisfying class on the topics of Lisp and its foundations.</p>

<p>Protocol Validation is alright, it's got a good approach to the topics
covered. Mu-calculus is up my alley, the way of expressing process is
simple yet expressive. It's a bit like logic programming. Although the
subject concerns imperative processes, the mode of expression seems
opposed to such linear thoughts. When working in it, one should
consider sets and families of processes, rather than a particular
implementation of one form of process. In this it's useful for
abstracting procedures and talking about them in generically
applicable ways. Quite interesting, but I've still a ways to go before
I really grok it.</p>

<p>We have a homework assignment due late October we're meant to pair up
for, but I dawdled on that and may be one of the only people left
without a partner...</p>
