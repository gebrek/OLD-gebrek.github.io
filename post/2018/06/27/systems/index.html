<main>
<p>It's difficult to observe a system, especially from inside of it. A
system doesn't exist as a thing-in-itself per-say, but the
relationships and interactions between things within the
system. Observation of the system is especially difficult the more
complex and larger it is, obviously, but to observe a system from
within it as a complex actor is nearly impossible. As an actor within
a system, conscious of the system, one has knowledge of what it is
that is necessarily incomplete: a member cannot encompass the set.</p>

<p>Importantly, the best systems aren't dictated on high, but
emergent. Perhaps not all the best systems, but the majority. This is
because to be a good system, it must consider the requirements of its
constituents. This aspect is unimportant in computer systems, because
those are in fact dictated from on high, and the constituents are
unconcerned because they have no needs. At least simple ones. Perhaps
one may think of a distributed computer system as consisting of
independent actors that have their own lives. This introduces a high
degree of complexity to a system so it is no wonder why it isn't
commonly implemented. It may make stronger systems though.</p>

<p>In many human systems consciousness of the system is a pre-requirement
for participation in the system, at least to some degree. Democracy
does not obviously function if the actors are not aware they're in a
democracy.</p>
