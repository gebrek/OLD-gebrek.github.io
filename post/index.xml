      <description>One month ago, on August 20 I landed in the Netherlands to do a Master degree at the VU Amsterdam. It&#39;s been a journey and already I can tell the experience will be well worth living. My flat is filled with 12 students, all of whom seem to be good company. If I recall, 4 are Master students the rest are Bachelors.
My neighbor at +1 is a hoot. He&#39;s an Estonian studying Mathematics.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s difficult to observe a system, especially from inside of it. A system doesn&#39;t exist as a thing-in-itself per-say, but the relationships and interactions between things within the system. Observation of the system is especially difficult the more complex and larger it is, obviously, but to observe a system from within it as a complex actor is nearly impossible. As an actor within a system, conscious of the system, one has knowledge of what it is that is necessarily incomplete: a member cannot encompass the set.</description>
