      <description>Life&#39;s full of do&#39;s and don&#39;t&#39;s. That many apostrophes may be among them.
How to catch cache the fleeting thoughts they whisk by like lost time. Who&#39;s the elephant who&#39;s the rider. How much of now is back then? How have previous potentials reduced to now? Where in time do my roots belong?
There are sleeves of me sloughed off and withered from memory, but existing as standing waves in time.</description>
