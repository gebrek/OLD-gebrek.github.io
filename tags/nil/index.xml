      <description>It has been about four weeks since the start of the period, and the semester. The classes have been alright, although I had to drop the one I was really interested in: Lambda Calculus. Not sure if I&#39;ll ever have a satisfying class on the topics of Lisp and its foundations.
Protocol Validation is alright, it&#39;s got a good approach to the topics covered. Mu-calculus is up my alley, the way of expressing process is simple yet expressive.</description>

      <description>One month ago, on August 20 I landed in the Netherlands to do a Master degree at the VU Amsterdam. It&#39;s been a journey and already I can tell the experience will be well worth living. My flat is filled with 12 students, all of whom seem to be good company. If I recall, 4 are Master students the rest are Bachelors.
My neighbor at +1 is a hoot. He&#39;s an Estonian studying Mathematics.</description>
